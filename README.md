# Embedded Development of Handwritten Digit Recognition
## Intro
- This is about the course project of 'Embedded System' at Tongji.  
- We realize üìùhandwritten digit recognitionüëÄ based on STM32H747I-DISCO.
- More details can be found in Report.pdf
  
## Demo
- The function is shown as below.

## Model
- We use a basic CNN structure to detect and classify digits, which performs well on the MNIST Dataset.
- Look at Folder 'Handwritten Digit Recognition_Python' for more details.

## Embedded System
- We use CubeAI as a bridge between neural networks and embedded systems.
- Look at Folder 'Project' for more details.
